## Description
This is the second (the first one is Pink) template for practice from HTML Academy. Here I employed adaptive and fluid layout techniques together with responsive images (retina@2x and svg), custom-built icon fonts, svg and traditional png sprites.

The original design encompassed three resolutions (mobile, tablet and desktop), with four breakpoints envisaged by me:

at 320px,
at 768px,
and at 1200px.
Main technologies employed: SCSS as CSS preprocessor and Grunt as project build tool. See package.json for the list of plugins/dependencies and gruntfile.js for details of my workflow.
