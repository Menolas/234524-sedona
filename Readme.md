## Description
This is template for practice from HTML Academy. Here I employed adaptive and fluid layout techniques together with responsive images (retina@2x and svg), svg and traditional png sprites.

The original design encompassed three resolutions (mobile, tablet and desktop), with three breakpoints envisaged by me:

at 320px,
at 768px,
and at 1200px.
Main technologies employed: SCSS as CSS preprocessor and Grunt as project build tool. See package.json for the list of plugins/dependencies and gruntfile.js for details of my workflow.

## How to deploy
1. Clone the project from Github.
2. Install all required dependencies via NPM (run npm install in your terminal while in the project root directory). Note: you also need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine.
3. Run "start" command in the terminal window.
